### Overview

This project is a Front End Mentor coding challenge where I aimed to reproduce a similar desktop design. The goal was to build out the QR Code component and get it looking almost identical to the original design.

### My process

I started by reading through the challenge requirements to ensure that I fully understood the desired outcome.

It was vital for me to break down the challenge into smaller parts to make it easier to solve. For example, I considered how searching for the required fonts and color schemes would help to streamline and organize the CSS properties.

Next, I spent a decent amount of time studying the design layout to understand the HTML structure and then began adding the text content.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Cascading Style Sheets

### What I learned

While working on this challenge, I gained deeper insight into:

- Developing a good eye for design.
- Breaking down the challenge into manageable parts.
- Hosting projects onto the Vercel platform.
- Organizing my workflow.

### Continued development

I want to learn the best practices for using media queries such as combining multiple conditions, grouping similar media queries to keep my CSS more oraganized, and limiting the amount of breakpoints.

An example for combining conditions - if the user turns orients their device to landscape mode, I'd still want the QR Code to be visible on the entire screen without the need to scroll down.

Lastly, limiting the amount of media queries will make my code more manageable and clean.
